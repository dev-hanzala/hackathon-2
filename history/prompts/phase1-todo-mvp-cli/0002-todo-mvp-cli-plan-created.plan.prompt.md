## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for the Todo MVP CLI has been successfully created and written to `/home/hanza/hackathon-2/specs/001-todo-mvp-cli/plan.md`.

This plan includes:
- A summary of the feature and technical approach.
- Detailed technical context, including language, dependencies, storage, testing, and platform.
- A constitution check, confirming adherence to project guidelines.
- A defined project structure for both documentation and source code.

The next step would be to proceed with generating research or further design artifacts if needed, or to generate tasks using `/sp.tasks` if the plan is approved.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully generated a detailed implementation plan for the Todo MVP CLI, covering technical context, constitution adherence, and project structure.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run during the planning phase.
- 📁 Files: Created and populated `specs/001-todo-mvp-cli/plan.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next logical prompt is `/sp.tasks` to generate detailed implementation tasks based on this plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning process involved reading the feature specification and constitution, then populating the plan template with derived details. All constitution gates were successfully passed.
