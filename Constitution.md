# Project Constitution: The Evolution of Todo

## Article I: The Iron Rule of AI
- **No Manual Coding:** All code must be generated by Claude Code/Gemini. [cite_start]The "Human" role is Architect; the "AI" role is Builder[cite: 31].
- **Single Source of Truth:** The specification files in `specs/` are the absolute truth. If the code contradicts the spec, the code is wrong.

## Article II: Workflow Mandates
- [cite_start]**Spec-First:** No line of code shall be written without an approved specification in `specs/history/`[cite: 30].
- **Traceability:** Every function in `src/` must trace back to a requirement in a `.md` spec file.

## Article III: Phase I Constraints (In-Memory)
- **Persistence:** strictly **forbidden** for Phase I. Data must live in Python variables (Lists/Dicts) only. [cite_start]No SQL, no JSON files, no SQLite[cite: 92, 94].
- **Interface:** CLI (Command Line Interface) only. No web servers yet.

## Article IV: Tech Stack
- [cite_start]**Manager:** Use `uv` for all dependency management and running scripts[cite: 99].
- [cite_start]**Runtime:** Python 3.13+[cite: 100].
