# Implementation Plan: Todo MVP CLI

**Branch**: `001-todo-mvp-cli` | **Date**: 2025-12-30 | **Spec**: /home/hanza/hackathon-2/specs/001-todo-mvp-cli/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/hanza/hackathon-2/specs/001-todo-mvp-cli/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature implements a Phase I Todo MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as a command-line interface (CLI) application. It will support core todo functionalities such as adding, listing, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. All task data will be stored strictly in-memory, without any persistence mechanisms.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: `uv` (package manager), `pytest` (testing), `ruff` (linting/formatting)
**Storage**: In-Memory (global Python list/dictionary for tasks)
**Testing**: `pytest` for unit and integration tests.
**Target Platform**: Linux (Command Line Interface)
**Project Type**: Single project CLI application
**Performance Goals**: Responsive command-line interactions; immediate feedback for all operations.
**Constraints**: Strictly in-memory data storage; no external databases, files, or persistence layers are allowed in Phase I. CLI-only interface.
**Scale/Scope**: Designed for a single user with a small to moderate number of tasks (MVP).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **No Manual Coding**: This plan adheres to the rule that all code will be generated by Claude Code/Gemini.
- **Single Source of Truth**: The specification in `/home/hanza/hackathon-2/specs/001-todo-mvp-cli/spec.md` will remain the absolute truth.
- **Spec-First**: Implementation will only proceed after the specification is approved.
- **Traceability**: All functions implemented will trace back to requirements in the spec.
- **Persistence (Phase I)**: Adheres strictly to the in-memory constraint; no persistence mechanisms will be used.
- **Interface**: The interface will be CLI-only, as per the constitution.
- **Manager**: `uv` will be used for all dependency management and script execution.
- **Runtime**: Python 3.13+ will be used as the runtime.

All constitution gates are passed.

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
src/
├── todo_console/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py        # CLI entry point and command parsing
│   └── models.py      # Task data structure definition and in-memory storage logic
└── tests/
    ├── unit/
    │   └── test_models.py  # Unit tests for Task model and storage logic
    └── integration/
        └── test_cli.py     # Integration tests for CLI commands
```

**Structure Decision**: A single project structure is selected, with a `todo_console` package under `src/` to encapsulate application logic. `main.py` will handle CLI interactions and `models.py` will manage the in-memory data structure. Tests are separated into `unit` and `integration` directories under `tests/`.
